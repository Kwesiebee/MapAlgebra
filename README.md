# MapAlgebra
This resource seeks to simulate what was done in the eBook QGIS and Open Data for Hydrological Applications-Exercise Manual. (Exercise 4: Map Algebra) with the R programming language. 
It Introduces student like myself to the concept Map Algebra, which is highly needed to handle effectively Raster data (WCS). In the workflow is demonstrated how to use the Raster package in R and also how to visualize the output of geospatial analysis using the tmap package. 
Many thanks and appreciation to Dr. Hans van der Kwast the author of QGIS and Open Data for Hydrological Applications-Exercise Manual.
